Related Topics Simple Tag List
==============================

The final output checks each tag and only displays it if at least one other post exists. If exactly one other article has that tag, the tag name then links directly to that post. Otherwise, the tag name will link to the tag archive.

Not only are links intelligently created, but the link’s title attribute is updated to say “View Related Post” if linking directly to post, or “View Archive of Related Posts” if linking to tag archive.

An options page under Settings allows choosing from an inline listing with customizable separator, and a basic bulleted list. HTML can be added before and after the list. Not listing HTML before the list effectively removes the title. No additional classes or CSS are added by this plugin. Tag links will use whatever color is defined by the theme.

This plugin is best for sites that use tags in a purposeful way connected to a content strategy. It’s an especially great way to connect content for beginning blogs, but can also grow with the site.
